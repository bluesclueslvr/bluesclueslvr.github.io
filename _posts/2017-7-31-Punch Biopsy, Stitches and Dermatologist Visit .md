On Friday 7/28-I went to my first ever dermatologist.  I was referred by my doctor for a weird cluster of marks on my ankle.  The doctor had no clue what it is and sent me to the dermatologist.  When I get there, the dermatologist also didn't know what is on my ankle and decided I needed a biopsy. This strange marking basically appeared over time.  It went from what I thought was a pinch from a buckle on my shoe, to a cluster of dark marks.  They don't hurt, they don't itch and they aren't raised.  They look like a a bunch of blood blisters to be honest.  My concern is that they are spreading on my ankle, rather than going away over time.  
  
I had what is called a punch biopsy.  Where they use a tool, to punch out a chunk of skin (including part of the fatty tissue) for testing, and then stitch the hole. This is my first ever cut into any part of my skin and my first ever stitch.

I must say I am getting better with the doctor's office and have learned to calm down.  I had to get a shot of Lidocaine first, and they always ask if you are allergic to certain things, but in all honesty, I couldn't tell you.  I am not a big medicine taker, I don't run to the doctor for any and everything...so I said, well I guess I will find out after I am injected.  So far so good...no issues.  There is a slight burning when the medicine reaches your blood stream, but it still wasn't as bad as my dental appointment I had the same day, or as bad as the Hep A vaccine I just got (they say tetanus hurts, but that's false compared to Hep A).  
  
I will get my results back in about 1-2 weeks, fingers crossed it is nothing, and they can offer me a cream to remove the dark spots.  I also need to get my one stitch removed in about 2 weeks, I could feel that being sewn and that was weird for sure.  
  
This requires a lot of maintenance, cleaning twice a day with an unscented soap, Vaseline and Band-Aid.  They gave me band-aids, but they are so small that the sticky part touches the damn stitch. What the hell?  I am using my own bigger ones.  At least they gave me Vaseline, cause I really don't use it and don't own it.  Right now I have it worked out, that I placed some gauze behind my band-aid, and I know the stitch is protected.  Last thing I want to do is pull that by accident.  
  
I also cannot do any vigorous working out.  This puts a damper on my vacation body and I have to keep up with abs and arms for the next 2 weeks.  I am going to attempt the treadmill Tuesday, but I think I won't be able to hang.  You never realize how closely connected all your joints and muscles are until you can't use them.  Sleeping has been a doozy, if I don't position my leg correctly it feels like the skin is tearing open.  I didn't sleep well today because of it.  I turned too fast and thought I ripped the whole stitch open.  Other than that, life is peachy and I am hoping this is nothing more than tender skin that has been bruised.  
  
I'll post an update once I know what the issue is, if any.  
  
  
So I realized that I never came back and updated my results.  This is very old, but I am alive.  It turned out to be a benign rash called pigmented purpuric dermatosis.  Basically inflammed capillaries.  There is no known cure and the only thing they said that would help is compression socks and moisturizer.  So I basically went through all that for nothing.  I am happy it is really nothing, but the stitch and the constant changing of the bandages made more marks then I had before.  I still keep an eye on it to make sure there are no new red marks and I keep more heavy lotion on it than before.  Other than that, it is just an ugly mark I will have on my skin, because I don't forsee it going away.
