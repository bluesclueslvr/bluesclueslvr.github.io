We went to see Chance the Rapper 4/27 at Golden 1 Center.  His tickets were so reasonably priced, the only issue I have is with fees Golden 1 charges.  $25 extra per ticket...that was half the price of the ticket.  But other than that, pretty good.  
  
So the show was amazing.  He is quite the performer and even cried a little, as he was excited to be headlining is own concert.  
  
He danced, sang, chatted, it was like a real concert.  All things were great, and he really put on a show.  My two friends were familiar with his music, but even they enjoyed the show and said they would see him again.  
  
Enjoy the combination of Snap Chats and regular video:
