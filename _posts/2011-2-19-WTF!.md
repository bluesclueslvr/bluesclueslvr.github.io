I can make no comments to [this.](http://fitperez.com/2011-02-18-same-bacteria-found-on-toilets-mall-food-trays?from=PHheadline)  All I can say is, we as Americans are filthy, dirty, lazy, entitled, people. And because we have more freedoms than most, we take a disgusting advantage of the world and people around us. Being gross for no reason other than pure laziness.  No wonder I have strep throat. Who in the hell knows where I really got it from.
