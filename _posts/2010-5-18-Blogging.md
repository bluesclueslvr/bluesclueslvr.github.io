I am going to start blogging. Hopefully I can make this a regular occurrence and post frequently. Mostly about stuff going on around me; thoughts/feelings, complaints, funny antics. I need an outlet, until I find the right therapist for me and writing about it usually does it for me.  
  
Stay Tuned!!!!
