I am probably one of the worst bloggers, since I hardly post.  But with that said, thanks [Breanne!](http://breezyinbloom.blogspot.com/)

I guess I need to start posting more regularly since I've been mentioned on a very well read blog.

  
On to the good stuff:

  
1.  I truly believe the world is ending in some form in 2012, and spend hours online researching it. And daydreaming about all the things, I need to do/won't get to do in less than a year.

  

2.  I found a love for math at ARC, and wanted to be a math teacher for a good 2 years.  Eventhough, when I was younger, I was "bad" (see lazy) at math.

  

3.  I hate massages and being rubbed, BUT...I have such stress and tension that I have enjoyed the 2 I've gotten.  But am still tense while I'm getting the massage, that I never fully relax.

  

4.  Littering is a HUGE pet peeve.  I don't get it?

  

5.  I love shoes, owls, and monkeys. I collect all things related. and plan to someday get a tattoo of each in some form.

  
6.  I collect R's. Notebooks, stamps, wall letters, cups etc...

  
7.  I want to be a professional organizer. I love storage, organizing and cleaning.

  
Now on to the unfortunate part...I don't actually follow 10-15 blogs. Womp, womp.

  
But this was fun nonethless!
