Ahhhh, let me tell you how much I enjoy juicing.  It is a satisfaction that I can't even begin to explain. Prepping the fruits and veggies and coming up with flavor combinations is the most fun.  I love looking up new recipes for combinations I would not even actually think of.  Right now I really like red cabbage in most of my juices.  It has an interesting aftertaste but it really adds a sweetness to most juices.  I have also enjoyed beets in most of my juices so I try to incorporate them as much as possible,  
  
This week I ventured out and added celery.  If you know me, then you know I don't like celery in my drinks.  I like to eat celery, but I cannot stand it juiced.  This juice is pretty rough to drink each morning because all I taste is celery!  It kills me but I already prepped everything so I must drink them.  
  
But below are the pictures for juice prepping for a delicious set of juices.  For breakfast I had carrots beets, apples, cabbage, and pineapple.  And for dinner I had strawberries, spinach, peaches, and blueberries.  This is how I prep my juices.  Either in Ziploc gallon bags or containers.  
  
(I had to post my cabbage especially because when I cut it, it made a star and I thought it was dope).

Update:  I am so obsessed with my immersion blender, that I took my last bananas and mushed them up for banana ice cubes, to add flavor to my juices.  I know, I know...I am so incredibly smart.  It's amazing.
