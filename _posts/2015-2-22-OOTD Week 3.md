So, I have gotten a little lazy when it comes to my outfits for work.  Usually, I have my outfits picked for the week on Sunday.  (We even had a 3-day weekend, and I still slacked off)  I have a system.  I paint my nails, and whatever color strikes me is what I try to make my outfits match along with.  Week 3 didn't happen like that.  I didn't even take a picture of my nails.  I only painted them a solid color, no designs, and took it off before I remembered about the blog.  Oh well, I at least have a picture of the nail polish itself.  Grey Area, by Sally Hansen.  One of my favorite colors.  
  

**Enjoy Week 3**
