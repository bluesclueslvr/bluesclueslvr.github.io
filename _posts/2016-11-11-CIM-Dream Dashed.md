My dreams of running the CIM have been dashed yet again by plantar fasciitis.  It is so annoying, but I can't keep training on this poor foot of mine and risk further injury.  And it is starting to move to my other foot.  
  
I have had to defer my race again this year.  But this time I am actually saddened by it.  I have been training (although not with the group), but I have been following the plan much more than I ever thought I would.  I kept a positive attitude about running and my aches and pains.  But I must do the smart thing.  
  
Maybe next year I will be a lot thinner and have less pain in my foot to allow me to complete this tasks.  We shall see.
