This post is SUPER late, but it is going up.  I am going to cram this site full of delayed postings just in time to catch up for the current and last week of September. Man, time is flying, but it also means Halloween is coming.  And if you know me, then you know I am excited.  
  
Anyway, this is lunch prep for 9/6-9/9.  I can't even remember the calories I counted for this meal, but I know it was lightweight.  In my tuna we have mayo, mustard, relish, boiled eggs, chopped black olives and dried onion.  I used romaine lettuce leaves and cherry tomatoes (which ShiShi does not like...so picky) and wheat pita pocket thins (100 calories per half).  It ended up giving us 1/2 cup of tuna which was too much for the pocket so it was really filling.  The honey mustard is to die for and it tastes just like Chick Fil A sauce.
