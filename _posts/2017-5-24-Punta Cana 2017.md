WE ARE GOING TO THE DOMINICAN!  
  
This will be my first true trip to another country.  I have been to Canada before and yes I get that is another country, but it's not quite the same.  When I went you didn't need a passport.  Just a birth certificate.  So this trip is going to be an experience.  
  
We are going through [Club Med](https://www.clubmed.us/r/Punta-Cana/y?CMCID=SNN152565466332), they had the best prices and are all-inclusive.  This trip includes, airfare, hotel, food and drinks as well as some activities on the resort.  
  
They have Cirque de Soleil there, which is about to be dope.  As scared as I am of heights, I must try the trapeze.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  They also offer some workout programs included in the package, one being archery---I have always wanted to attempt this so I am excited as heck.  
  
Off the resort we are going to try the underwater ocean walking--through  [Seaquarium](http://www.seaquariumpuntacana.com/seaquarium-en/).  This offers, the walking, a picture with a Sea Lion and swimming, with both Nurse Sharks and Stingrays.  They also will have some party time and lots of drinks.  It shows it is about $100, which includes pick up and drop off from the hotel and some light eats.  I am about this life for sure.  
  
We also want to do a [horse back tou](http://www.horseplaypuntacana.com/adventure-river-tour.html)r through the ocean and this one comes with zip lining as well.  Same offer of pick up and drop off and is about $100.  
  
The last thing we think will be pretty cool is the [cigar tour](http://www.donlucascigars.com.do/).  It allows you to learn to roll your own cigar, tastes some whiskeys and it includes a visit to a hidden water spot.  Same pick up and drop off at hotel and same $100 price.  
  
I think this is going to be a great trip, there are some really fun activities that we are going to attempt if we can get times available.  Fingers crossed.  
  
I am going to comeback and post about the trip once it occurs. Stay tuned!!
