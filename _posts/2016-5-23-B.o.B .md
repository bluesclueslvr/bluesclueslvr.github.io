This was the best concert I have been to in a while.  I love me some Bobby Ray Simmons.  So nothing could have ruined this moment.  I was so close, and I swear to goodness this man looked me directly in my eyes.  Ask Debbie, she thinks he did the same to her, and she doesn't love him like I do.

  

**He is Beau-ti-ful!**

  

This is just a tiny blurb of the evening as it went.  I am working to upload the rest of the videos to my youtube channel.
