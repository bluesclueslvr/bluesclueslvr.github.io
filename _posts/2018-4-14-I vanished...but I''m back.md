Well ya girl is back.  I was working for a mortgage company back in December and they changed their settings for internet and I couldn't post to my blog at work.  I know, sad.  That was my best time to get blog posts done at work.  Now I have to start fresh with the new year at home.  
  
Let me update you a little on life.  I had been applying for new jobs back in December as well, working with anywhere near this bitch, Julie Yarbrough...yes I'm naming names, helped me want to move on seriously.  Mortgage was never going to be my end all be all, so there was no reason why I wouldn't start applying for new jobs in my field of HR.  Well ya girl finally got a new job in HR.  I Started in February with a school district and was very happy.  There is more to the work saga, but we won't be discussing, why it's a was and not an is.   
  
In short, I am working, enjoying life, making more money and tackling all the goals I have set out for myself.  
  
So prepare for food prep pics and ootd pics to come back.  I want to start posting other topics, I have taken an interest fixing up my house, so I may have some posts for that.  I just painted my dining room and living room, but didn't take any before and after pics.  But I love it so much.  I will definitely post pics of my new flooring that I plan to lay down soon.  
  
I also want to start posting on my gym time.  I hope to start vlogging that soon.  I will see how that goes.  
  
All in all, I'm ready to focus back on my blog, get some views, maybe help someone else with ideas and release some stress by focusing my energies into my posts.  
  
Talk soon
