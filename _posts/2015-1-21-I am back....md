I am going to open this blog up one more time.  The last time I posted was 2011, and it was a lot of negative posting.  So this year, I will be more positive. I am going to post all things related to ME!  
  
Outfits of the day, shoes of the day, lipstick of the day...whatever I feel like.  Food pictures, recipes.  Working out, my struggle with training for a marathon.  The loves of my life, Bijoux and Bexley.  School stresses, hair journey, dating (maybe), mostly random things that happen to me or to people I know.  
  
This should be fun.
