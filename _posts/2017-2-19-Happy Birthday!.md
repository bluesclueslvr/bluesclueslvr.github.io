Today my girls turn 4.  I can't believe it's been that long.  So in honor of their birthday I decided to make them a vegan dog treat.  I was not about to go buy ingredients so I googled some recipes with peanut butter, since I new I had that on hand.  I have just about everything else, so that wouldn't be a problem.  
  
I found a recipe on this site [Vegaprocity](https://vegaprocity.com/2014/10/homemade-vegan-dog-treats/).  It has some interesting stuff on it so I tried the recipe.  I used 1 cup of flour and 2 cups of coconut flour.   I also used a smidge less peanut butter, that shit sucks to scoop out.  And I added more water as it was mixing.  It was looking pretty dry.  I ended up with 1/2 a cup of water total.  
  
The mix still didn't form into balls like a regular cookie would, so I just mashed them in my hand and whatever shape I got is what I got.  My girls are not picky about shapes (because they're dogs).  
  
I had a lot of mix left so I put the rest in a baking dish.  Maybe it will make bars or something.  
  
The recipe says 10 mins, but my ish started to burn on the cookie sheet.  But I put the baking dish back in for another 10 mins.  
  
Once they were cool, they held together pretty well.  Still a little crumbly, but they will do the job. Enjoy the pics.  
  
And HAPPY HAPPY, to my annoying, energetic, loving, loyal, overweight, excitable, smart, friendly, and wild girls!
