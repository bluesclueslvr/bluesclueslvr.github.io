Are you noticing a theme with the food prepping.  These past two weeks have been salads or salad like.  This is the last salad for September, which is good becuase I am sick of salads.  
  
I recreated the McDonald's Southwestern salad, with a different dressing. Southwestern dressing cannot be found apparently, as I went to 2 stores with no luck.  So instead I got my favorite El Torito Caesar Pepita.  
  
Enjoy the 3 pics I have...you get the gist.  It was supposed to look similar to this:  Which it basically did.
