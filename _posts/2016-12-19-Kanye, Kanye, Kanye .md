Read the title in [Sway's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S78tT_YxF_c) voice.  
  
So I foolishly bought tickets to the Kanye show.  I knew full well that it could go one of two ways. He will perform and put on a great show, like Watch the Throne or he will go off on a tangent.  
  
I'm sure you can guess which Kanye we got.  
  
Truthfully, I don't have an issue with how Kanye rants and raves until he starts speaking recklessly. We all know full well that he did not wish Donald Trump to be our president. He likes to say stuff to get under people's skin.  And that comment was that.  
  
More than anything I was disappointed in the Golden 1 Center.  This is a new center and the seats we had were tiny.  Much smaller than the space at Arco.  All the money it cost and that's the best we could get?  I was also saddened by the viewing of the show.  They waited until 15 minutes in before we were able to see anything on the big screens.  I have the video of Kanye ranting.  It was more manic than anything.  In my opinion he wasn't saying anything that really required such news.  He often goes off on tangents throughout tangents, which is what he did here.  He did make some interesting points, but mostly he was just talking about anything and everything that popped into his head.  Almost like, if the thought came up he said.  It didn't have to fit, he just blurted it out.  
  
Oh well, I at least got some good pics of me and the center.  It was nice to experience.  And since I got my money back it was a free show (with the exception of parking and dinner).  Not really any more money than any other night out.
