        <p>Welcome to my blog. An outlet where I will share a little of my life.</p>
        <p>I am trying to make my adult life work for me, navigating and moving one day at a time.</p>
        <p>I am interested in health and fitness, beauty, and fashion.</p>
        <p>I love to laugh, be goofy and have an all around good time. I value my friendships and family dearly.</p>
        <p>I have two mini Australian shepherd retrievers and 1 kitten that I love immensly.</p>
