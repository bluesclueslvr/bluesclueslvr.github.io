        <p>Welcome to my blog. This is an outlet for me where I will share a glimpse into my life and all the things.</p>
        <p>I am trying to make my adult life work for me. Navigating and going one day at a time.</p>
        <p>I am interested in health and fitness, beauty, and fashion.</p>
        <p>I love to laugh, be goofy and have an all around good time. I value my friendships and family dearly.</p>
        <p>I have two mini Australian shepherd retrievers and 1 kitten that I love dearly.</p>
